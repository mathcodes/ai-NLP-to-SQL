## Phil's Journey to Data Infrastructure and Cloud Technology
Phil started his journey by being addicted to computers since he was a child. He had a thirst for technology and has been fascinated by it ever since. He came to Silicon Valley 25 years ago for a year, and he never left. Phil and his co-founder started Soft Iron about 10 years ago, where they had persistent water cooler conversations about the amazing public cloud. They were fascinated with the public cloud's consumption model and how it could be replicated on premise, in a cola, or in a hybrid sense. As they kept watching, they got increasingly frustrated with the industry's inability to see a path to replicating the public cloud experience. The idea of creating a cloud as a sovereign entity led to their current business.

## The State of the Industry Today
Phil has a schizophrenic view of the state of the industry. Technology moves so fast that we lose tools and technologies behind us in the name of progress. However, from the outside, it moves incredibly quickly, and the capabilities are staggering. Nevertheless, the industry is dealing with increasing complexity, which creates a lot of tension with cybersecurity. Therefore, a comprehensive approach to cloud security is necessary to avoid being locked in or creating massive shadow I.T.

## **`Data Centric Security`**
**`Data centric security`** is an approach that focuses on data and its resilience. Data is everything, and the hyperscalers use it as a weapon of war to monetize their business. However, **`data centric security`** is one lens of many, as there are other important aspects of security to consider. Therefore, a comprehensive approach to security that focuses on the protection in depth of methods is necessary.

## Conclusion
**`Sovereign clouds`** and **`data centric security`** are crucial in today's fast-moving technological world. It is important to consider the depth of methods and a comprehensive approach to security to avoid being locked in or creating massive shadow I.T.

# Part 2

Welcome back to "In Any Kind of Time." In this part of the talk, Nicolas Chaillan and Phil Straw continue their discussion on **`data centric security`**.

## Access Control and Granularity
Phil emphasizes the need for comprehensive access controls that can adapt to various scenarios. This includes considerations such as role-based access control, attribute-based access control, and varying levels of authorization and authentication. While there isn't a one-size-fits-all approach, Phil stresses the importance of being precise with the granularity of access controls.

## Enabling Access Controls through Products
When it comes to enabling data access controls through products, Phil highlights several key pieces, such as robust encryption, comprehensive audit trails, and enforcement mechanisms. Products that allow for easy discovery and monitoring of data are also essential, as data is constantly growing and evolving. Phil also believes in the importance of having a human owner to oversee the access control process.

## Process vs. Product Approach
Phil notes that there is a common tendency to focus on either the process or the product side of **`data centric security`**. However, Phil argues that a comprehensive approach must encompass both sides. The process side includes policies, management, and continuous data discovery, while the product side enforces access controls, encryption, and audit trails.

## Conclusion
**`Data centric security`** is a complex but crucial consideration for any organization. A comprehensive approach must encompass both process and product considerations and adapt to various scenarios. Phil emphasizes the importance of precision in access controls and enabling them through robust encryption, audit trails, and enforcement mechanisms. Meanwhile, staying vigilant and maintaining a human owner to oversee the process is key to success.

# Part 3

Welcome back to "In Any Kind of Time." In this part of the talk, Nicolas Chaillan and Phil Straw continue their discussion on **`data centric security`** and the complexities of making it work in various use cases, including different cloud environments.

## Trust and Auditing
Phil and Nicolas discuss the importance of trust and auditing in **`data centric security`**. While it may be necessary to trust certain parties in some cases, it's crucial to have a means of auditing and understanding the potential downside of that trust. Phil emphasizes the importance of focusing on security outcomes rather than simply mitigating risk and extra caution when it comes to public cloud environments, where the consequences of data disruption are often unclear.

## Data as a Living Product
The two also discuss the life cycle of data and the importance of considering data access controls throughout its duration. Data should be viewed as a living product, even when it's immutable, with constant visibility and access. Phil emphasizes the need for a comprehensive and consistent approach to **`data centric security`** that adapts to various scenarios and considers the value of the data being protected.

## AI and Anomaly Detection
Finally, Phil and Nicolas touch on the potential of using artificial intelligence for monitoring and detecting anomalies in data disposition and movement. AI can be particularly helpful for detecting transient data and ensuring that it's being adequately protected.

# NOTES:

 - AI helpful for detecting and preventing data breaches and data leaks.
   - AI can continuously monitor network **traffic** and **logs** to ID any **unusual patterns**
   or behaviors that do not conform to normal usage of the system.
   - AI algorithms can learn from **historic data patterns** and can identify signs of **anomalous behavior**,
   which may be indicative of an attempted ** **.

 - In data-centric security, AI can be leveraged to monitor data disposition and movement within the cloud environment. AI can be used to implement access controls for data based on user behavior and identity. AI can identify data that is classified as "transient", meaning it's only supposed to be accessed temporarily for a particular use case. To ensure such data is being correctly protected, AI systems can facilitate setting up access controls for such data based on usage patterns and restrictions on data sharing.

 - Overall, AI technology provides an additional layer of protection for data-centric security which is critical in ensuring the privacy and security of sensitive data.
```

## Bottom Line
In conclusion, **`data centric security`** is a complex and far-reaching consideration for any organization. A comprehensive approach that takes into account both process and product considerations is crucial, as is precision in access controls and enabling them through encryption, audit trails, and enforcement mechanisms. While trust may be necessary in some cases, auditing and understanding the potential downside of that trust is crucial. Data should be viewed as a living product with constant visibility and access control consideration throughout its life cycle. Finally, AI can be a helpful tool in monitoring and detecting anomalies in data movements.

# Part 4

Welcome to the fourth and final part of "In Any Kind of Time," where Nicolas Chaillan and Phil Straw continue their discussion on data-centric security and the complexities surrounding the creation of **`sovereign clouds`**.

## The Importance of Options
Phil emphasizes the importance of having options when it comes to data-centric security and **`sovereign clouds`**. The tension between needing to know and control versus trusting and consuming infrastructure needs to be considered, and neither option is fundamentally wrong. It's important to embrace the hybrid nature of technology and consider the benefits of both **`sovereign clouds`** and public cloud environments.

## The Importance of Productization
Phil stresses the importance of embodying data-centric security in products rather than simply attempting to replicate what's being done in hyperscale environments at a smaller scale. This involves not just auditing every facet of the product but also ensuring the product has specific properties that are more radical than traditional infrastructure. While keeping up with the progress in commercial clouds or hyperscalers can be difficult, it's not impossible to create a **`sovereign cloud`** that can match and even surpass these environments with the right technology and productization approach.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, data-centric security and **`sovereign clouds`** pose significant challenges, but it's essential to consider the benefits and drawbacks of both options. While supply chain risk is a major concern, it's possible to mitigate this risk through diligent auditing and a focus on security outcomes. Data should be viewed as a living product, and access control should be considered throughout its life cycle. AI can be a valuable tool in monitoring and detecting anomalies in data movements. It's crucial to have options, both for controlling and knowing and for trusting and consuming infrastructure. Productization is key to embodying data-centric security in a way that can surpass traditional infrastructure and match hyperscale environments.

With these considerations in mind, organizations can take a more comprehensive approach to data-centric security and **`sovereign clouds`**, ensuring that their data is protected against potential risks and their IT infrastructure is resilient against threats.

# Part 5
## Nicolas Chaillan and Phil Straw on Software Supply Chain Risk and Data-Centric Security

When it comes to software supply chain risks, Phil Straw and Nicolas Chaillan agree that the impact is significant. Straw highlights how supply chain risks have been exploited increasingly, and how it has become frighteningly easy to insert vectors of attack into platforms, code, and software. For instance, compromises can occur via dependencies from other teams, or by infiltrating into the development and build servers. Such risks can also impact data-centric security by inserting trust vulnerabilities in the architecture.

Straw further states that supply chain risks involve both hardware and software supply chains, beyond just software. Attackers can exploit the long-term, persistent vectors of attack by embedding malware or collecting data that could be abused or compromised. To tackle such risks, Straw emphasizes that the entire spectrum of supply chain risks has to be tackled, which involves both hardware and software, as well as its design and mechanism. Auditable mechanisms that embody the principles of zero trust are critical to mitigating such risks.

Chaillan and Straw then delve into the challenges that small-scale governments or teams face when building **`sovereign clouds`**. Though governments might have the money to invest, smaller teams have limited resources that would make it difficult to keep up with the progress of commercial clouds. Moreover, cloud providers such as Google, Amazon, and Microsoft are trying to develop their own security measures to tackle the supply chain risk. Despite this, Straw contends that both public and **`sovereign clouds`** have a place in a company's or government's infrastructure, depending on the trust factor and the level of control needed.

Finally, the discussion ends on the note that there should be an option to make technological choices that fit the needs of the organization. Chaillan shares an example of how one can use a private cloud to safeguard sensitive data and use public cloud for off-site backups. Straw advocates that in the end, it is about achieving **`Sovereign Cloud`** properties and embodying them in technology to mitigate risks.

## Nicolas Chaillan and Phil Straw on Auditable Provenance and Hyper Cloud Technology# (Part 1)

In the continuation of their conversation, Nicolas Chaillan and Phil Straw delve deeper into the concept of auditable provenance. Chaillan believes that auditable provenance is a spectrum of mechanisms that enable a zero-trust outcome on a compute platform. It essentially involves proving the trustworthiness of all components and mechanisms involved in a system. To achieve this, Chaillan emphasizes the need for auditability of all mechanisms and processes. Without auditability, it is impossible to understand the level of trust injected into a system, making it hard to ascertain the incumbent level of risk.

Chaillan and his team at hyper hyperscalar have worked for a decade to embed provenance as a property of their product, making it auditable and reproducible on a bill-by-bill basis. The process of achieving provenance is expensive and complex, but it ensures a zero-trust outcome. The idea is to audit every mechanism and ensure that every piece of firmware, boot code, and software that runs on a system is auditable and reproducible from source code to binary and vice versa.

Straw raises the issue of cost and how it compares to not achieving provenance. Chaillan believes that it is impossible to achieve provenance without embedding it as a property of a product or portfolio of products. The cost of not achieving provenance is massive and could lead to long-term, persistent threats that could complete compromise a system. While the cost of auditing vendors could be high, Chaillan believes that the benefits far outweigh that cost.

Chaillan also discusses hyper cloud technology, which is a way of building clouds from technology. Hyper cloud technology refers to the holistic approach to building a technology platform that is meant only for clouds. The idea is to build an almost zero-touch and zero-integration fabric and make all components of a cloud consumables. For instance, compute, storage, and acceleration should be self-organizing and self-orchestrating. All components run identical software, and there is no assumption made about the system, making it zero-trust by definition. The join mechanism is designed to make all components work naturally together, resulting in a different day-to-day experience.

In conclusion, Chaillan and Straw have addressed critical issues in software supply chain risk, data-centric security, auditable provenance, and hyper cloud technology. The discussion highlights the importance of auditability and zero trust in achieving security and mitigating risks. It also emphasizes the cost of not achieving provenance and how products such as hyper cloud technology can help organizations achieve auditable provenance and a zero-trust outcome.

Soft Iron CEO Phil Straw speaks with interviewer Nick Chaillan about the future of the company and the challenges they face in a fast-moving technological environment. Straw emphasizes the challenges of building a product that is pure and consistent, with secondary properties like provenance that are essential for building trust and mitigating risk.

Straw also discusses hyper cloud technology, which he likens to building a cloud from technology. The approach involves building a holistic platform that is designed solely for clouds, with an almost zero-touch and zero-integration fabric. The goal is to make all components of the cloud consumable and self-organizing, with identical software and zero trust assumptions.

Straw notes that Soft Iron's success relies on building a team with deep experience and expertise in building hard things across many industries. The team is over 100 people strong, with over a thousand years of previous working experience together. Soft Iron's approach is radical and different, but Straw is optimistic about the promise of technologies like AI to upgrade virtually every product consumers touch.

In conclusion, Straw emphasizes the need for companies to focus on building products that are pure and consistent, with auditable provenance and other secondary properties that are essential for building trust and achieving a zero-trust outcome.
